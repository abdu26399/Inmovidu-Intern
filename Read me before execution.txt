One is a live face mask detection project. Other is image mask detection project
Due to some reason, it(live) is detecting only dark blue coloured masks. It's facing a little difficulty while detecting light blue masks,
and this can be improved in further tweaking of the hyperparameters.

Before Execution,
Move the "Experiment" folder to the C: Drive as I have set the path there.

Then execute the code blocks as mentioned in the .ipnyb files.

The models have an accuracy of 96% and 97%.

I have used the Prajnasb face mask dataset for both the models which can be found online and I have attached it in the folder also called experiment.

Thank you.
